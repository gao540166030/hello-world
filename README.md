# Humidity, temperature and security monitoring system on museum relic

As we all know, the cultural relics in the museum are extremely valuable and even some artifacts were unearthed thousands of years ago. They are the soul of human wisdom. They are meaningful tools that can help us to understand the history and reveal the truth. Therefore, we should protect these precious cultural relics. After displayed in the museums, we must prevent the relics from theft. Aiming at providing all aspects of protection to the relics, this project designed a monitoring system on the temperature, humidity and security of relics.

In this project, three sensors are used to combine a sound system to monitor relic in the museums. Specifically, this project is made up from two modules, of which the first is the temperature and humidity detection module, where a DHT11 sensor is used. It can detect the temperature and humidity within the cultural relics environment and response to different temperatures according to the set value. It can also transfer real-time information to portable devices (computers). To be more specific, if the environmental temperature of the cultural relics is set to a normal value (below 25 degree), the green LED is on. Once the ambient temperature of the cultural relics is set to a set warning value (26-30 degrees), the fan start working (Cooling treatment) and the yellow LED is on. If the ambient temperature of the cultural relic is close to the damaging value (higher than 31 degrees), the fan will continue to work and the red LED will be on. 

The second module is about security monitoring system. The purpose of this module is to detect the safety conditions around the cultural relics environment and to achieve real-time alarm function when the environment around the relics is not safe. It is consisted of two sensors. One is the HC-SR501 human infrared sensor, which makes real-time response to anyone close to the artifacts and alarm. As is known to all, when the museum is closed, there should be no one trying to get close to the relics. So once someone is approaching, the manager must be notified in real time and the yellow LED should be on (yellow LED light for this system). The other is the inclination sensor, which is used to detect whether artifacts showcases are unlawfully destroyed or not. Inclination sensors are installed in all corners of the cultural exhibition. Once it detects the illegal destruction of exhibition cabinets, there will be real-time notification to managers and the alarm will set off (red LED light, buzzer alarm). If everything goes normal, the LED light stays green.
